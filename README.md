# HumidForecast

This project aims to read real-time humidity and temperature data from an ESP32 sensor and leverage this information to train a powerful predictive model. The ultimate goal is to accurately forecast humidity and temperature trends for the next 4 hours. By doing so, we can efficiently control a humidifier, saving energy while maintaining optimal indoor conditions.

This project combines hardware interfacing with data analysis and machine learning techniques to create a smart and energy-efficient solution. Through the development of a robust predictive model, we strive to enhance indoor comfort while promoting sustainability.

Let's make the future greener and more comfortable together is the main objective of this project.
